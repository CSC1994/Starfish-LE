#Starfish-LE

![Starfish logo](starfish.png)

Starfish is a 2D Cartesian or axisymmetric code for simulating plasmas or rarefied gases. 
Please review https://www.particleincell.com/starfish for more information as well as
the [five step tutorial](https://www.particleincell.com/2012/starfish-tutorial-part1/).
The input files are included in the dat/tutorial directory. There you will also find
a [PowerPoint presentation](dat/tutorial/starfish-code-overview.pdf) with some introductory remarks about the source code.

The LE edition includes support for the Particle In Cell (PIC) method with Monte Carlo (MCC) collisions,
as well as several gas injection sources, a preliminary support for fluid and kinetic materials. The
code can be easily extended with plugins. 

The full version (limited distribution) implements plugins for Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC),
Navier Stokes solver, and sources specific to plasma thrusters.
