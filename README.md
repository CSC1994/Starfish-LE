#Starfish-LE

[Starfish](https://www.particleincell.com/starfish) is a 2D Cartesian or axisymmetric code for simulating plasmas or rarefied gases. 
It consists of two "editions", light and regular. The light edition is what is posted here.
It includes support for the Particle In Cell (PIC) method with Monte Carlo (MCC) collisions,
as well as several gas injection sources, a preliminary support for fluid and kinetic materials. The
code can be easily extended with plugins. 

The full version implements plugins for Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC),
Navier Stokes solver, and sources specific to plasma thrusters. This version is not publicly available.


##Getting Started
First, take a look at the
[five step tutorial](https://www.particleincell.com/2012/starfish-tutorial-part1/) posted on the PIC-C site.
The input files are included in the dat/tutorial directory. There you will also find
a [PowerPoint presentation](dat/tutorial/starfish-code-overview.pdf) with some introductory remarks about the source code. The associated video is [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDFeT_X-IsU).
